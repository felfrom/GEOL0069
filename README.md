# GEOL0069
The file "Chapter1_Unsupervised_Learning_Methods.ipynb" tackles the work we have undergone in week 4 of GEOL0069.
We covered the usage and implimentation of unsupervised learning, particularly K-means and Gaussian Mixture Models clustering. We used these techniques (to varying effects) to attempt to classify sea ice and leads using Sentinal-2 data.
