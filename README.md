# GEOL0069
The file "Chapter1_Unsupervised_Learning_Methods.ipynb" tackles the work we have undergone in week 4 of GEOL0069.
## unsupervised Learning
We covered the usage and implimentation of unsupervised learning, particularly K-means and Gaussian Mixture Models clustering. We used these techniques (to varying effects) to attempt to classify sea ice and leads using Sentinal-2 data.

## Altimetry Classification
Using Gausian Mixture Models, we were able to calssify Sentinal-3 data into sea ice and leads, and retrived the echos waveforms. We investigated the the mean and standard deviation of these calssifcations and used allignment techniques to identify the change.

## ESA Comparison
Finally we comapred our classifcation with that of the European Space Agency (ESA), and found that our methods worked well, with a high frequency of correct classification.
